    1 Declare one instance variable of type Heap to store your data
    2 Code a one parameter constructor that takes a boolean that indicates whether a lower number should have a higher priority. 
        -If the parameter is true, then the constructor should instantiate the Heap as a min heap. 
        -If the parameter is false then the constructor should instantiate the heap as a max heap.
    3 Code a default constructor to either call the other constructor passing true or instanitate the heap as a min heap(priority queue does this naturally)
    4 Implement the methods in IPriorityQueue. IPriorityQueue has five methods you should implement each one.
